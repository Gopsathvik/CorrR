# CorrR

Latest Update Date: 2019 Feb.

# Overview

This project is developed to help users calculate correlation coefficients and covariance matrix of a given data with missing values in both R and Python.

# Functions

- `std_plus`

Standard deviation calculates how close the data points to the mean, in which an insight for the variation of the data points. This function would automatically handle the missing values in the input.

- `corr_plus`

Correlation coefficients calculates the relationship between two variables as well as the magnitude of this relationship. This function would automatically handle the missing values in the input.

- `cov_mx`

A Covariance matrix displays the variance and covariance together. This function would use the above two functions.
